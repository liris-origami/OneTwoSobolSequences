# Sobolâ€™ Sequences with Guaranteed-Quality 2D Projections


## Standalone sampler

* `main.cpp`: standalone samples generator (builds with  `make`): number of points and number of dimensions can be passed as command line options, eg `./main 256 8` would generate 256 8D points.
* pre-compiled matrices are available in `onetwo_matrices.cpp`. 
* fast point generation functions are in `onetwo_matrices.h`. 
* both files have been generated by the utility `export_matrices`.

## PBRT-v4 plugin

The `pbrt` folder contains an update of pbrt-v4 that includes our new sampler, denoted `OneTwo-sequence`. This folder also contains a zip of the complete source code and the cornell-box scene.
